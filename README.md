## Background

I figured Iâ€™d release the project I used to learn C++ ~7 years ago. It *should* work on Linux, Mac, and Windows. It has been tested and works on macOS. Multiplayer has been disabled for the sake of convenience.

## Build

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

## Run

`cd RadishShooter/`

`./RadishShooter`
